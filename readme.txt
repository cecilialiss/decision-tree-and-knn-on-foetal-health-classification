==== INSTRUCTIONS ====

Simply run 'DT_Final_Model.m’ BEFORE ‘kNN_Final_Model.m’ to reproduce the results. 
(Some variables used in ‘kNN_Final_Model.m’ are from ‘DT_Final_Model.m’)

Files to run for test
‘DT_Final_Model.m’ contains the script to run for test set
‘kNN_Final_Model.m’ contains the script to run for test set

Other files
'DT_Final_Model.mat' contains the trained decision tree and test set
'kNN_Final_Model.mat' contains the trained kNN and normalised test set
'DT_model_selection.mlx' contains a live script for decision tree training
'kNN_model_selection.mlx' contains a live script for KNN training
'fatal_health_initial_analysis.ipynb' contains all data preprocessing and initial data analysis

Python was used for data preprocessing and initial data analysis for convenience.
